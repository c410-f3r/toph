A blockchain with smart contracts support intended for the `Polkadot` network.

There are two nodes deployed on `35.192.47.173` and you can check one of them using https://polkadot.js.org/apps/ through `wss://35.192.47.173:9943`. Please, try to access https://35.192.47.173:9943 before exploring because this testnet is using self-signed certificates.
